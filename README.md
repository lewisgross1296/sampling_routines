This purpose of this repository is to gain experience handling the generation of
CDFs from tabular PDFs, while ensuring the sampling of these CDFs does not violate
the continuous energy assumption. It aims to correctly sample for different types 
of interpolation policies while handling the CDF inversion of a piecewise PDF
